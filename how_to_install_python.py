            Python is a versatile programming language known for its ease of use.
            It's widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more thanks to its extensive library of third-party extensions.
            Python emphasizes simplicity, productivity and community engagement, making it a popular choice for both beginner and experienced programmers.
            Let's get you started by walking through the installation process for the programming language and its most popular interactive development environments (IDE).
            We'll incidentally also touch upon installing some common third-party extensions so that you can extend the functionality of Python according to your needs.

st.header("Installing an IDE")
st.markdown('''
            While you can write Python code in any text editor, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) can make coding easier and more efficient.
            An IDE is a software application that offers tools like a code editor, debugger, and build automation, all in one interface.
            There are many IDEs for Python because they cater to different needs and preferences.
            
            While any IDE (such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text) can be used for general Python coding, some are specialized for scientific computing and data analysis.
            Spyder and the Jupyter Project's offerings, for example, provide tools for interactive computing, data visualization, and integration with scientific libraries.
            In the next steps, we walk you through the process of installing Spyder and Jupyter Notebook to make sure you get to use Python comfortably.

st.markdown('''
            Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
            It also has the ability to integrate with numerous libraries for data analysis and visualization such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, as well as machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
            Although widely used in scientific research, Jupyter Notebook really shines in education applications thanks to its interactive and integrative format!

            Jupyter Lab offers an integrated development environment for working with notebooks, code, and data.
            It provides a more flexible and powerful user experience compared to Jupyter Notebook, featuring drag-and-drop functionality, multiple document support, and a customizable workspace.

            To install Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab, you'll need to use Windows PowerShell.
            It's therefore essential you've added the Python installation location to your system path during the Python installation.
            Python uses the "Python Package Index" (PIP) to install most third-party extensions.
            You can use PIP to install Jupyter Notebook, and the process is nearly identical for installing Jupyter Lab.

            You can also lauch Jupyter Notebook directly from within Windows PowerShell.
            On the command line, enter "*jupyter notebook*" and hit return.
            An instance of your notebook environment should be booted up in your default browser.

st.success('''
           **Pro tip: Install third-party extensions!**
           
           There are many third-party extensions which expand the functionality of Python.
           You can easily install any of these by calling the "*pip install [...]*" command within Windows PowerShell.

st.markdown('''
            Note that this process will not install any shortcut to Jupyter Notebook and/or Jupyter Lab on your PC. 
            Instead, you can launch the IDEs from within Windows PowerShell at any time.
            Visit the official website for the [Jupyter Project](https://www.jupyter.org/) to read more about Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab.

            A final congratulations on successfully installing your second (and possibly third) IDE! üéä
            You now have several powerful tools at your disposal for tackling science and engineering projects or sharing your knowledge with students.
            Your next task is to get comfortable with Python and its syntax, as well as the development environments you've installed.
            Take some time to explore their features and capabilities to make the most out of these powerful resources.
